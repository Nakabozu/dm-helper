        meetingJingle: `After completing the puzzle, a keyhole in the stone grows to reveal worn stone steps leading down into what feels like a cellar. 
        A chill wind caresses you as you hear rhythmic steps on stone and smell the subtle scent of metal on the air.  
        From out of the passage, a goblin appears.
        She looks thin and frail, wears a coat lined with metal keys, and carries a flail that has padlocks for heads.
        She manages a faint smile and says, “Such brave folk to climb Telemy Hill in its current state.  How might Jingle Jangle unlock a bit of happiness in your lives today?”`,
        jinglesChamber: `From a distant spot within the chamber, sputtering candles illuminate a multitude of keys dangling from taut strings that crisscross the walls.
        Hundreds of other keys lie strewn across the dirt floor.
        As you take in the scene, you hear the sound of keys jingling as a goblin emerges from the dimness.`,
        insight: [`Jingle Jangle is friendly. She collects keys and talks about them endlessly.
        She wears a coat of keys that jingle and jangle when she walks—hence her name.
        She used to be great friends with Telemy Hill, the voice of the land of Hither, before Bavlorna visited and Telemy began to change.
        She was raiding the hill for fruit and truffles when she was spotted by one of Telemy Hill's trees and attacked.  She has been in recovery for weeks, and her food and water stores are nearly depleted.  What's left is rotting and tainted.`],
        taleOfWoe: `Jingle Jangle was sneaking around, digging for the truffles that dot the top of Telemy, when Jingle Jangle's cloak of muting slipped.  
        The clinks of Jingle Jangle's keys alerted the trees.`,
        offerings: `A bag of truffles, a tasty snack, or purification of her rotten food.
        A thirst-quenching beverage or purification of her tainted water.
        Healing for her wounds.`,
        theCore: `Jingle Jangle leads you to a spiraling path claiming "This will take you to the core, but it's too much for Jingle Jangle."
        You descend down the path for minutes on end.  Let me know if you'd like to react to anything on your way down.  
        You descend so far your ears pop and you still can't see the bottom. You continue futher down, your hair stands on end.  
        Even further and you hear raspy chuckles in your mind.  The smell of the bog is stronger than ever.
        Further still hideous tendrils creep from the darkness just beyond your vision.`
